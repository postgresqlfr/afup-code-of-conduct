# PostgreSQLFr's code of conduct

PostgreSQLFr is an organization dedicated to promote PostgreSQL in French 
speaking countries.

We value the participation of each member of the PostgreSQL community and 
want all attendees of PostgreSQL events to have an enjoyable and fulfilling 
experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy 
to other attendees throughout the organization events and at all conference 
events, whether officially sponsored by PostgreSQLFr or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, 
organizers and volunteers at any PostgreSQLFr event are required to conform to 
the following Code of Conduct.

## Guidance

### Versions

This code of conduct is versioned through GitHub's convenience.

As the code of conduct should be updated for each new event (i.e. Emergency 
contacts), a tag on the last valid commit for this event should be created. The 
tag may be added after the event took place. Although there's no official syntax 
for those, a tag should be explicit.

### Structure of document

The following decisions have been made:

* Starting with an introduction of PostgreSQLFr's state of mind regarding its tech 
  events. As you just read, **they are tech events** thus they don't need to be 
  tinted with any personal points of view regarding unrelated topics that can 
  be mean to others. We aim at broadcasting our events at the majority 
  interested in PostgreSQLFr like, for example, minors.

* Presenting a short version of the code of conduct, showing quickly its purpose.

* Showing Emergency contacts just after to place them up, well exposed for quick accessibility.

* Writing the full code of conduct for complete procedure.
